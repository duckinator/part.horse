CD4011 - Quad 2-input NAND gate
===============================

The CD4011 contains four 2-input NAND gates, and can be powered by 3 to 18 volts.
It is available in 14-pin DIP (through-hole) and 14-pin SOIC/SOP/TSSOP (surface-mount) variants.

More details, and datasheets, can be found on the `Texas Instruments product page`_.
